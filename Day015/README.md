# Day 15 – Coffee Machine & Snake Game

## Overview
Two practice projects:
- Procedural coffee machine simulator (resource management, user input).
- Classic Snake game (movement, collision, scoring).

## Files
- coffeeMachine.py – text-based menu: espresso/latte/cappuccino, resource check, coin processing, report, off.
- snake.py – turtle-based Snake implementation (grid movement, food, score, game over).

## Coffee Machine Concepts
- Dictionaries for menu and resources.
- Function decomposition (check_resources, process_coins, make_drink).
- Loop and state management.
- Floating point handling for money.

## Snake Game Concepts
- Turtle graphics.
- Coordinate updates and direction control.
- Collision detection (wall, tail, food).
- Incremental growth and scoring.

## Run
```bash
python coffeeMachine.py
python snake.py
