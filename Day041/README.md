## File Structure
```
Day041/
├── index.html      # Main movie ranking website
└── README.md       # This file
```

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in any web browser
2. View the formatted movie ranking website
3. Customize with your own movies by editing the `<h3>` titles and `<p>` descriptions
4. Modify the CSS in the `<style>` section to change colors and layout

## Customization Ideas
- Add more movies beyond the initial three
- Include movie poster images with `<img>` tags
- Add release dates and ratings
- Create links to IMDb or similar movie databases
- Add movie genres as additional metadata
- Include a rating system (e.g., ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)

## Key Takeaways
- HTML provides semantic structure through heading hierarchy
- Horizontal rules (`<hr>`) effectively separate content sections
- Paragraphs should contain descriptive, meaningful content
- CSS can enhance plain HTML without changing the document structure
- Proper spacing and typography significantly improve readability

## Next Steps
Consider enhancing this project with:
- Advanced CSS for better styling and animations
- JavaScript for interactive features (e.g., sorting, filtering)
- Local storage to persist favorite movies
- Integration with movie APIs for real-time data
