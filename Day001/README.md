# Day 1 - Python Basics

## Overview
Day 1 introduces fundamental Python concepts including printing to the console, string concatenation, f-strings, and user input handling.

## Projects

### 1. Band Name Generator (`tasks.py`)
A simple interactive program that generates a band name by combining:
- The city you grew up in
- Your pet's name

**What You'll Learn**:
- Using `print()` function
- Taking user input with `input()`
- String formatting with f-strings
- Basic variable assignment

**Usage**:
```powershell
python tasks.py
```

**Example Output**:
```
Welcome to the band name Generator.
whats the name of the city you grew up in: 
> London
whats your pets name: 
> Fluffy
Your band name could be: London Fluffy
```

### 2. Bread Recipe (`Main.py`)
A simple program that prints a step-by-step bread recipe to the console.

**What You'll Learn**:
- Multi-line print statements
- Numbered instructions
- Basic program structure

**Usage**:
```powershell
python Main.py
```

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Print Function**: Displaying text to the console
- **String Formatting**: Using f-strings for dynamic text
- **User Input**: Getting data from the user with `input()`
- **Variables**: Storing and using data
- **Newline Character**: Using `\n` in strings

## Running the Code

From the repository root:
```powershell
# Run band name generator
python .\Day001\tasks.py

# Run bread recipe
python .\Day001\Main.py
```

Or navigate to the Day001 directory:
```powershell
cd Day001
python tasks.py
python Main.py
```

## Next Steps

Practice creating your own variations:
- Modify the band name generator to include more inputs (favorite color, birth month, etc.)
- Create a recipe for your favorite dish
- Build a simple story generator using multiple inputs
